### Who am I?

In ‘before-times,’ we all had our life-anchoring routines. The pandemic changed all that — work, school, socializing, you name it — forcing us to do just about everything *differently*.

Out of necessity, we tried new things, self-evaluated ourselves, dabbled in stuff, even risked a little failure here and there. We got seriously into self-care, moving more, meditating more. We went outside and connected with the natural world. We focused more on reducing stress, feeling gratitude, getting more rest.

In short, **we all suddenly had a lot of time on our hands**, so we *thought* and *self-reflected*. As the pandemic untethered us from our normal rhythms, it also put us in some sort of an ‘identity crisis’ (cause we don’t really self-scrutinise that often, lol). 

But, that was 2020. One year on, as we prepare to face normalcy once again, the natural question that pops up in our minds is— 

“Who am I, who should I be in office, at home, with friends; what is the label that I can label myself with, and which part of my character to conceal, which to lay bare?”

### Thinking about our identity less in terms of one-off labels.

In 2010, Stephen Fry was interviewed by 14-year-old Eden Parris in an interview for *Radio Times,* whom he told,

> “Oscar Wilde said that if you know what you want to be, then you inevitably become it – that is your punishment, but **if you never know, then you can be anything**. There is a truth to that. We are not nouns, we are verbs. I am not a *thing* – an actor, a writer – I am a person who *does* things – I write, I act – and I never know what I am going to do next. I think you can be imprisoned if you think of yourself as a noun.”

So many people think you have to first call yourself (say) an artist 👩‍🎨, know who you are and what you’re about, and *then* only you can start making art. No, no, no. You do the stuff first, then you can worry about what it is, who you are. The important thing is *the practice*. The doing. The verb.

Because you know; we are made up of multitudes and we should embrace that, rather than sort of confining ourselves to a particular label 🏷. 

 We aren’t nouns, we are verbs. Forget the nouns, do the verbs; and let live.
