    subtitle: For the curious,
    content: >
        My stage name is TheFuzz, and I love creating things. Things that make me happy. It might be a new craft or trying my hand at a new sport that I hadnâ€™t discovered before, or squeeze some creative use out of some old, forgotten object lying in the garage, or even maybe writing a my sequel of a movie that I liked... And I am an eager learner... and I find *everything* interesting... There is no end to learning something new, something that might just gets my mojo *sky high* and has me leaping out of my bed with another idea!
